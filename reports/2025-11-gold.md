## Executive Summary

**1. What Changed:** In the past 30 days, the most significant shift has been the decline in real interest rates, with the 10-year TIPS yield dropping by 1.09%. This decrease in real yields is typically bullish for gold. However, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has strengthened by 0.69%, which is generally bearish for gold. Despite the strengthening dollar, gold has continued to rally, indicating a potential decoupling or anomaly in the usual inverse correlation between gold and the dollar.

**2. Why It Matters:** The decline in real interest rates suggests a favorable environment for gold, as lower real yields decrease the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold. This is amplified by moderate central bank purchases, which continue to provide a supportive backdrop for gold prices. The strengthening US dollar, however, presents a headwind, potentially limiting gold's upside. The combination of these factors indicates a mildly bullish regime for gold, where the impact of falling real yields and central bank buying outweighs the negative pressure from a stronger dollar.

**3. Position Implications:** Given the regime score of 1.25, which indicates a moderately bullish outlook, it is advisable to maintain or slightly increase gold positions. The conviction level is moderate, suggesting that while there is potential for further gains, caution is warranted due to the USD strength. Investors should monitor key risks, such as any unexpected shifts in central bank policies or sharp movements in the dollar, which could alter the current regime dynamics. Staying alert to changes in geopolitical risks or broader market sentiment could also provide signals for future adjustments.
