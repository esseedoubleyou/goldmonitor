## Executive Summary

**1. What Changed**

Over the past 30 days, the most notable trend shift is the continued rise in real interest rates, with the 10-year TIPS yield increasing by 4.97%. This upward trajectory in real yields is typically bearish for gold as it increases the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold. Conversely, the US dollar has shown signs of weakening, with the DXY index down by 1.95% in the same period, which is traditionally supportive of gold prices. Despite these counteracting forces, gold prices have stabilized, indicating a possible decoupling from rising yields, which could be influenced by other factors such as central bank purchasing activity.

**2. Why It Matters**

The macro regime currently presents mixed signals for gold. The sharp rise in real yields is a structural factor that generally suppresses gold demand, as higher real returns from bonds make gold less attractive. However, the weakening of the US dollar can offer a supportive backdrop, as a cheaper dollar makes gold less expensive for foreign buyers. Additionally, central banks have continued moderate buying, which provides a buffer against the negative impact of rising yields. These conflicting drivers suggest that while there is pressure on gold from a fundamental perspective, the market is not reacting as strongly to these pressures, possibly due to the mitigating effects of currency movements and central bank actions.

**3. Position Implications**

Given the regime score of -0.25, which reflects a neutral stance, the current environment warrants holding the existing position in gold. The mixed signals from rising real yields and a weakening dollar suggest a lack of clear directional momentum. While the upward pressure on yields poses a downside risk, the weakening dollar and ongoing central bank purchases provide a degree of support. Investors should monitor the trajectory of real yields closely, as a continued rise could further pressure gold prices, and watch for any significant shifts in central bank buying patterns or geopolitical developments that might alter the risk environment. Overall, the current setup lacks a strong conviction to initiate new positions or exit existing ones.
