## Executive Summary

**1. What Changed**

Over the past 30 days, the most significant shift has been the notable decline in real interest rates, with the 10-year TIPS yield dropping by 1.14%, reinforcing a bullish environment for gold. Concurrently, the US dollar has strengthened, with the DXY increasing by 1.22%, which typically acts as a bearish counterforce to gold. Despite the strengthening dollar, gold prices have risen by 6.99% over the last month, outperforming the S&P 500, suggesting a robust demand for gold that overrides the dollar's influence.

**2. Why It Matters**

The macro regime is currently mildly bullish for gold, driven by the decline in real yields, which significantly impact gold's attractiveness as a non-yielding asset. The strengthening dollar would usually pose a headwind; however, the decline in real yields and moderate central bank purchases of 166.5 tonnes in the latest quarter has provided enough support to maintain upward momentum in gold prices. This suggests a structural shift towards a more favorable environment for gold, with central banks continuing to view gold as a strategic reserve asset amidst stable geopolitical risks.

**3. Position Implications**

Given the regime score of 1.25, there is a moderate conviction to maintain or slightly increase gold positions. The combination of falling real yields and central bank purchases outweighs the bearish influence of a stronger dollar, justifying an optimistic stance on gold. Investors should remain vigilant for any abrupt changes in real interest rates or a reversal in central bank buying patterns, which could alter the current bullish outlook. Monitoring these key macroeconomic drivers will be crucial for adjusting positions in the coming months.
