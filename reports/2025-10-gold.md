## Executive Summary

**1. What Changed:** In the past 30 days, the most significant shift has been the sharp increase in real interest rates, with the 10-year TIPS yield rising by 6.55%. This is typically bearish for gold, as higher real yields increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold. Concurrently, the US Dollar has strengthened with a 0.76% increase in the DXY index, adding further downward pressure on gold prices. Despite these headwinds, gold has shown resilience, evidenced by an 8.01% increase in the 30-day return, indicating some anomaly potentially driven by other factors like central bank purchases.

**2. Why It Matters:** The macro regime currently points to a mildly bearish outlook for gold, primarily due to the dual pressures of rising real yields and a stronger USD. These factors traditionally lead to lower gold prices as they diminish gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset. However, central banks' moderate buying activity of 166.5 tonnes in the latest quarter provides some support, suggesting that institutional demand might be counteracting negative price pressures to some extent. The combination of these elements suggests a cyclical trend rather than a structural shift, where temporary strength in gold could be at risk if macro conditions persist.

**3. Position Implications:** Given the regime score of -1.75, which is mildly bearish, and considering the current macroeconomic environment, it is prudent to maintain or reduce gold exposure. The conviction for this action is supported by the strong upward trend in real yields and the USD's appreciation, which are significant headwinds for gold. Investors should monitor potential catalysts such as shifts in central bank policy or geopolitical events that could alter the current macro dynamics. Additionally, any sustained changes in inflation expectations or real yield trajectories could necessitate a re-evaluation of gold positions in the coming months.
