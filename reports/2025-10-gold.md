## Executive Summary

**1. What Changed**

Over the past 30 days, the most significant trend shifts have been the sharp rise in real interest rates and the strengthening of the US Dollar. The 10Y TIPS yield has increased by 6.55%, now standing at 1.79%, which is typically bearish for gold. Concurrently, the DXY has strengthened by 0.76% to 120.52, adding further downward pressure on gold prices. Despite these headwinds, gold has outperformed the S&P 500 with a 30-day return of +8.01%, indicating an anomaly where gold rallies amid traditionally bearish conditions.

**2. Why It Matters**

The macro regime implications suggest caution, as rising real yields and a strengthening dollar generally signal a less supportive environment for gold. These are fundamental drivers that typically exert downward pressure on gold due to increased opportunity costs and reduced attractiveness of gold as a safe-haven asset. However, moderate central bank purchases provide some support, indicating continued institutional belief in gold's long-term value. The key here is to differentiate between cyclical noise—like temporary geopolitical tensions—and structural shifts in monetary policy, which drive sustained trends.

**3. Position Implications**

Given the regime score of -1.75, there is a mildly bearish outlook on gold, suggesting that maintaining or reducing exposure is prudent. The conviction level is moderate, reflecting the mixed signals where rising real yields and a stronger dollar counterbalance central bank buying. It’s critical to monitor the trajectory of real yields and the dollar, as further increases could lead to a more pronounced bearish regime. Additionally, any shifts in central bank policy or sudden geopolitical developments could act as catalysts, altering this outlook.
